  <h3>About Me </h3>
</p>

Hey there, I'm SpicyHamBoi (for short Spicy) I got into coding around May 2020 and it's something I genuinely enjoy doing now and will continue doing. I code in Python, Java, HTML and Kotlin. Most of my projects are coded in Python, Java or HTML. I would want to learn - C, C++, Go, JavaScript.

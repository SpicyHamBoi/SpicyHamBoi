## SpicyHamBoi
Hey there, I'm SpicyHamBoi (for short Spicy) I got into coding around May 2020 and it's something I genuinely enjoy doing now and will continue doing. I know python and java pretty well now and also know HTML and Kotlin. Most of my projects are coded in python or java or html. I would want to get into C, C++, Go, JavaScript and CSS. I usually code or play minecraft. Mostly into hacking tools, discord stuff and websites.

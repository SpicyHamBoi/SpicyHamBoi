## SpicyHamBoi
Hey there, I'm SpicyHamBoi (for short Spicy) I got into coding around May 2020 and it's something I genuinely enjoy doing now.  I know python and java pretty well now and also know HTML. The majority of my projects are coded in python or java. I eventually want to get into C, C++, Go, and JavaScript, and maybe more some day. I mostly code or play minecraft.

## Projects 
**works in progress** <br>
- OreTX- a discord bot.
  - postman++, a paid extension of postman with a few exclusive features.
- beach house, a private latest version fabric client for minecraft, based off bedroom.
- bedroom, a public latest version fabric base for minecraft clients.

**unfinished** <br>
- Moo Base, a public minecraft forge 1.12.2 client base, meant to be as simple as possible for anyone to use.
- get-on-top-of.me, a personal website i'm doing for fun, and will help me start getting into html and web development a little more.
- Las Venturas, a private minecraft 1.12.2 client in mcp that i'm mostly doing for the fun of it.

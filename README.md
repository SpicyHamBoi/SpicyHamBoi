## SpicyHamBoi
Hey there, I'm SpicyHamBoi (for short Spicy) I got into coding around May 2020 and it's something I genuinely enjoy doing now. I know python and java pretty well now and also know HTML and Kotlin. The majority of my projects are coded in python or java or html. I eventually want to get into C, C++, Go, and JavaScript, and maybe more some day. I mostly code or play minecraft.
